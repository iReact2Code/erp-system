## Current Architecture

### Database (Prisma)

- ✅ User management with roles
- ✅ Inventory items
- ✅ Sales with line items
- ✅ Purchases with line items
- ⚠️ Orders (schema exists but not fully implemented)

### API Routes

- ✅ Authentication (NextAuth)
- ✅ Users CRUD
- ✅ Inventory CRUD
- ✅ Sales CRUD with inventory sync
- ✅ Purchases CRUD with approval workflow
- ⚠️ Orders (basic endpoint, needs enhancement)

### Frontend Components

- ✅ Authentication forms
- ✅ Dashboard with tabs
- ✅ Inventory management
- ✅ Sales management with form
- ✅ Purchase management with approval
- ✅ Reports with real data
- ✅ Multi-language support (RTL ready)
- ⚠️ Orders table (basic, needs enhancement)

### Internationalization

- ✅ English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Chinese
- ✅ RTL support for Arabic and Hebrew
- ✅ Dynamic language switching

## File Structure Analysis

### Well Organized ✅

- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper component organization
- Good API route structure

### Could Be Improved 🔄

- Some components could be split into smaller pieces
- Consider implementing a proper state management solution
- Add proper error boundary components

## Performance Analysis

### Current State

- Good: Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Good: Component-based architecture
- Good: Proper database indexing

### Optimization Opportunities

- Add React Query for better caching
- Implement proper pagination
- Add virtualization for large tables
- Optimize bundle size with proper code splitting
